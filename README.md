## Features
 - Tree-shakable
 - Side-effects free
 - No dependencies

For frontend applications, it is worth checking out [Bundle Phobia](https://bundlephobia.com/package/@rocketleagueapi/items) and viewing the `Export Analysis` to see the GZipped cost of importing parts of the module. 

For example, `products` makes up the vast majority (~62kB) of the total package size (~72kB).  As such, importing all other parts would have a near-negligible effect on build sizes.

## Install

Install this package using your package manager of choice.
```sh
 npm i @rocketleagueapi/items
```
or
```sh
 yarn add @rocketleagueapi/items
```

## Example Usage
```js
const { products } = require('@rocketleagueapi/items');

// Where 32 is the product ID
const alphaBoost = products[32];
console.log(alphaBoost.paintable) // false
```

## Updating the Dump
Using [ItsBrank's CodeRed](https://coderedmodding.github.io/), we can dump the necessary information to update this module.  The information in this module is derived from the game and is extacted using CodeRed.  The commands needed to dump the `src/raw` JSON files can be found in `scripts/dump_databases.crsq`.

Run these commands and copy the resultant output from your CodeRed Dump folder to `src/raw`.

Afterwards, run the parse script:

```sh
npm run parse
```
